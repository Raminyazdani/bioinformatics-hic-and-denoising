Ramin Yazdani | bioinformatics-hic-and-denoising | main | WIP(deps): Add requirements.txt with core dependencies

Create requirements.txt specifying core scientific computing libraries needed for numerical analysis and visualization. Initial dependencies include numpy for numerical computing, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, and jupyter for notebook interface.

Specialized bioinformatics libraries (cooler, cooltools) will be added later when the Hi-C analysis workflow is implemented. This approach adds dependencies incrementally as they become needed rather than all at once.

Verification: requirements.txt created with numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and jupyter.
