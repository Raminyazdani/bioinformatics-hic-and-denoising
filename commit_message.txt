Attempt to update the data file reference in the image denoising notebook but accidentally introduce a typo. Changed the path from ../data/noise.csv to ../data/noisy.csv, which causes a FileNotFoundError when the notebook tries to load the data since the actual file is named noise.csv.

This represents a common development mistake where a simple typo is committed without running the full notebook verification first. The error is discovered when attempting to execute the notebook from scratch in the next session.

Issue: Notebook now broken, will fail with "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../data/noisy.csv'" when trying to read the data file.
