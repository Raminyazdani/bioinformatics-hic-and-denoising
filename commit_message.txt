Ramin Yazdani | bioinformatics-hic-and-denoising | main | feat(deps): Add cooler and cooltools for Hi-C analysis

Update requirements.txt with specialized bioinformatics libraries needed for Hi-C contact matrix analysis. Added cooler>=0.8.0 for handling Hi-C data in the .cool/.mcool format and cooltools>=0.5.0 for Hi-C analysis utilities including normalization algorithms.

These dependencies are added after implementing the Hi-C analysis notebook, ensuring the requirements file stays synchronized with the actual code dependencies. This allows others to easily install all necessary packages with pip install -r requirements.txt.

Verification: requirements.txt now includes all dependencies needed for both image denoising (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter) and Hi-C analysis (cooler, cooltools) workflows.
