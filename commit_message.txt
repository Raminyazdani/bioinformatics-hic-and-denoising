Ramin Yazdani | bioinformatics-hic-and-denoising | main | feat(docs): Final polish: enhance README sections and formatting

Apply final refinements to README.md for professional portfolio presentation. Changes include more professional tagline highlighting the specific computational methods used, enhanced "Problem & Approach" section with clearer articulation of the technical approach, more detailed tech stack descriptions explaining the purpose of each library, added "Reproducibility Notes" section emphasizing best practices, and improved formatting and clarity throughout the document.

Before considering the project complete, a final review ensures all documentation is polished, professional, and provides a complete picture of the project's capabilities and technical sophistication. This positions the project effectively for portfolio presentation.

Verification: README is now portfolio-grade with professional language, comprehensive technical details, and clear structure. All sections flow logically and provide the information needed to understand and use the project.
