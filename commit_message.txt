Ramin Yazdani | bioinformatics-hic-and-denoising | main | feat(docs): Improve README with detailed setup and usage instructions

Significantly expand README.md with comprehensive documentation to make the project accessible and easy to understand. Enhancements include more detailed problem and approach descriptions, clear repository structure diagram showing all directories and files, explicit setup/installation instructions (pip install -r requirements.txt), step-by-step "How to Run" instructions for Jupyter notebooks, detailed descriptions of inputs for each notebook, expected outputs and visualizations, and notes on reproducibility.

With both analysis workflows fully implemented and tested, the project needs thorough documentation so others can understand its purpose, set up the environment, and run the analyses. Clear documentation is essential for portfolio presentation and reproducibility.

Verification: README now provides complete information for a new user to understand, install, and run both analysis workflows. All sections are comprehensive and professionally formatted.
