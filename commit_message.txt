Ramin Yazdani | bioinformatics-hic-and-denoising | main | feat(denoising): Hotfix: correct data path back to noise.csv

Immediately fix the data path typo discovered in the previous commit. Corrected all references from ../data/noisy.csv back to the correct filename ../data/noise.csv, restoring the notebook to working order.

After the previous commit, attempted to run the notebook from scratch and encountered FileNotFoundError. Quickly identified the typo and created this hotfix to restore functionality. This demonstrates rapid response to fixing broken code before moving on to new features.

Verification: Executed the first few cells of the notebook to confirm data loads successfully. The pd.read_csv() call now works correctly with the proper file path.
