Ramin Yazdani | bioinformatics-hic-and-denoising | main | WIP(data): Add data directory with noisy image dataset

Add the data directory structure and the noisy image dataset (noise.csv) that will be used for testing the image denoising workflow. The dataset contains a 96x86 pixel noisy 2D image in CSV format suitable for demonstrating diffusion-based denoising.

Following data-driven development, input data is added before implementing the algorithms that will process it. This allows for testing with real data during implementation.

Verification: data/noise.csv created with 96x86 noisy image matrix.
