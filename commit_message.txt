Ramin Yazdani | bioinformatics-hic-and-denoising | main | feat(denoising): Implement diffusion-based image denoising notebook

Implement complete image denoising workflow using homogeneous 2D diffusion equation with finite difference method. The notebook (image_denoising.ipynb) includes data loading, diffusion step implementation using explicit finite difference scheme with periodic boundary conditions, efficient diffusion runner with snapshot capture, parameter exploration for different time steps (dt=0.1, 0.25, 0.4), and comprehensive analysis with visualizations.

The implementation demonstrates numerical methods for solving partial differential equations applied to image processing. The diffusion equation naturally removes noise by smoothing the image while preserving important features through controlled diffusion over discrete time steps.

Verification: Notebook executes successfully, loads data from ../data/noise.csv, produces denoised images at various timesteps, and includes visualizations comparing different parameters.
