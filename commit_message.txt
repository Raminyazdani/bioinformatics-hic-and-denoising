Add a comprehensive .gitignore file with standard patterns for Python and Jupyter Notebook development. This prevents accidental commits of temporary files, cache directories, virtual environments, IDE configurations, and other generated artifacts.

Following best practices by setting up gitignore early before any code is written ensures a clean repository from the start. Patterns include __pycache__, .ipynb_checkpoints, venv, .env, and common IDE directories.

Verification: .gitignore created with Python/Jupyter-specific ignore patterns.
