Ramin Yazdani | bioinformatics-hic-and-denoising | main | feat(hic): Implement Hi-C contact matrix analysis pipeline

Implement comprehensive Hi-C genomic contact matrix analysis workflow in hic_analysis.ipynb. The notebook includes fetching hESC Micro-C data from public repositories (Chromosome 2 at 1 Mb resolution), visualizing raw contact heatmaps before bias removal, implementing vanilla coverage normalization, applying ICE normalization (Iterative Correction and Eigenvector decomposition), and comparative visualizations of different normalization methods.

Hi-C experiments capture 3D genome organization by measuring chromatin contact frequencies. The analysis pipeline corrects for systematic biases in the contact matrices using iterative correction, revealing true biological interaction patterns. This complements the image denoising workflow by adding genomic data analysis capabilities.

Verification: Notebook successfully fetches data using cooler API, generates contact heatmaps, applies both vanilla and ICE normalization methods, and produces comparative visualizations showing the effect of bias correction.
